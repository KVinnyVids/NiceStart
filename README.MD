Hello Friend,
This is my very first project in AndroidStudio.
The app doesn't really work besides the buttons.

LogIn

SingUp

New Menu for the app, I'm considering to make it the profile tab

MainMenu

Recently added the splash screen, a load screen before the LogIn screen.
In here, I added a new blink animation to the icon, I tried to add a new font for the app

Splash

Now the splash screen has new animations

Hope you enjoy it! -_-
