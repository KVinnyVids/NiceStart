Hello Friend,
This is my very first project in AndroidStudio.
The app doesn't really work besides the buttons.

LogIn

SingUp

New Menu for the app, this menu shows a random face from the page https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ using a WebView

MainMenu

Recently added the splash screen, a load screen before the LogIn screen.
In here, I added a new blink animation to the icon, I tried to add a new font for the app

Splash

Now the splash screen has new animations, I added an overshoot animation to NiceStart and a zoom in to the logo.

Added a new feature, buttons in the action bar, just added a profile button, settings and a log out button.

Hope you enjoy it! -_-
